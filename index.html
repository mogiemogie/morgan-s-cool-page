         <h1 style="color:darkseagreen;">A lil' something about me ~</h1>
  <h2 style="color:darkslategray;">I came over to Pitt from Chatham's Immersive Media program my first year of college and am now in the second semester of my third year, pursing a major in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design with (maybe?) a minor in linguistics. I'm from Fort Myers, Florida and moved up here for high school. I'm super excited for this semester because it's the first time I'm taking multiple courses centered around design and I feel like I'm finally going to start learning about the things I'm interested in. Outside of school I really enjoy reading, collecting art books, painting and drawing, anime ofc, and chill, comfy video games. I hope we can all find common interests and am excited to learn a lot with you this semester!  </h2>

 <h1 style="color:darkseagreen;">Field of Study</h1>
  <h2 style="color:darkslategray;"> A huge passion of mine has always been art and video games so naturally when I first came into DNID, I chose video game design. Now, I've completely abandoned that idea and am on the online media track, more interested in front- end UX design, interaction design, and product management. Something I'd enjoy doing on the side as a freelancer is animation and digital art, creating character and environment designs, worldbuilding for myself or for commission work! I love designing things, whether it be worldbuilding in writing, drawing cool concept art, or in projects for classes like this. I've also always found the psychology around how people navigate spaces, whether they be digital, physical, or a combination of both, incredibly interesting. I like to think my field of study is a combination of design and art, which UX design fits perfectly into!   </h2>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
         <h1 style="color:darkseagreen;">Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product development? </h1>
  <h2 style="color:darkslategray;">I think I fit perfectly into front- end UX design with my passion for fun, visually appealing design that is both creative but also easy to understand and maneuver around. Usability testing is also something I'd love to be involved in in my future career endeavors, as a learning outlet through which to understand how other people view designs like my own through very different eyes. Studying feedback from real people, using my designs to navigate spaces, would both improve my own work and help me to constantly grow and become better. The entire world of UX design in the technological age is something I feel comfortable and excited to be in! </h2>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements--field of study, home and family, interests and activities? Why is this job or career important to you? Why is it important generally?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
         <h1 style="color:darkseagreen;">Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2 style="color:darkslategray;"> I want to be able to combine my skills in digital art and creative design with the knowledge I'll obtain this semester and beyond, creating designs for products that are both fun and enjoyable while also being simple and easy to understand. Wherever I end up, whether it be a tech position like front- end design or a more art- centered position like character design, I hope I can bring this love for creative worldbuilding into my work regardless of where I am. </h2>
